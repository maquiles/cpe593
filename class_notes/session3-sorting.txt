quicksort and heapsort are what he’ll probably ask us to do

bubble sort is bad but you need to learn it just out of principle



BUBBLE SORT
1 per each comparison and 1 per each swap

there is a way to swap without a 3rd variable

nlogn is the best that you can do with sorting that involves swapping
-as long as you don’t already know the order

heap sort is not as quick as quicksort, but you do not have to worry about pivot points
-more complexity but more comfort with heapsort

need to be able to write quicksort and heapsort for class next week

radix sort is not required - can sort faster with it but only for certain conditions
